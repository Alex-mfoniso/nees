# TODO List for Fixing Update and Delete Functionality

- [x] Add DELETE /api/products/:id route in server.js to handle product deletion
- [x] Modify the update product form submission in products.html to reload the product list after successful update instead of manually updating table row
- [ ] Test the update functionality to ensure image and fields update correctly
- [ ] Test the delete functionality to ensure products are deleted properly
